```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

2+2 = 

```{r}
# here I am just adding two numbers
2+2

# and here I am finding the remainder of 27 divided by 5
27 %% 5

# here is the number of students in the course, calculated using an arbitrary set of numbers 
57-53

```


In this course, I am interested in utilizing data mining to analyze langauge and narrative characteristics in older persons, both normally aging and at risk for MCI or dementia. I am interested in examining the semantic diversity and complexity of narratives. Additionally, I want to learn how to use N-grams for narrative analysis in machine learning. Eventually, I want to explore how narrative/language characteristics are related to measures of cognition, neural function and architecture, and risk for cognitive decline.
